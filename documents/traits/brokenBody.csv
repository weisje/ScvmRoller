Staring, manic gaze
Covered in (for some) blasphemous tattoos
Rotting face - wears mask
Lost three toes, limps
Starved - gaunt and pale
One hand replaced with rusting hook (d6 damage)
Decaying teeth
Hauntingly beautiful, unnervingly clean
Hands caked with sores
Cataract slowly but surely spreading in both eyes
Long, tangled hair; at least one cockroach in residence
Broken, crushed ears
Juddering and stuttering from nerve damage or stress
Corpulent, ravenous, drooling
One hand lacks thumb and index finger, grips like a lobster
Red, swollen alcoholic's nose
Resting maniac face; making friends is hard
Chronic athlete's foot - stinks
Recently slashed and stinking eye covered with a patch
Nails cracked and black, maybe about to drop off
