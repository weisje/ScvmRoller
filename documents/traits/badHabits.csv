Obessively collects small, sharp stones
Won\'t use a blade without testing it on their own flesh; arms knitted with scars
Can\'t stop drinking once they\'ve started
Gambling addict, must bet every day; if they lose, they raise and bet again
Cannot tolerate critism of any kind; results in rage and weeping
Unable to get to the point; they have never actually finished a story
Best friend is a skull; they carry it with them, tell it everything, they trust no one more
They pick their nose so deep it bleeds
Laughs hysterically at their own jokes which they then explain in detail
A nihilist; they insist on telling everyone they are a nihilist and explaining why
Inveterate bug eater
Stress response is aesthetic display; the worst things get the fancier they need to be
Permanent phlegm deposit in throat; continuously coughs, snorts, spits, and swallows
Pyromaniac
Consistently loses important items and forgets vital facts
Insecure shit-stirrer; will talk about whoever just left the room
They stutter when lying
They giggle insanely at the worst possible times
They whistle when trying to hide; they will deny this. (Whistle when a 5, 7, 9, 11, or 13 are rolled on a d20)
They make jewelry from the teeth of the dead; if this can be considered a bad habit
